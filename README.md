# SemanticTechnologyProject

A univesity assignment within my subject of the semantic web where we looked producing knowledge graphs via python with libraries such as spacy and completed webscraping through beautifulsoup. More details can be found within the specification md file and a short video demo.
I recieved a grade of 100%.
